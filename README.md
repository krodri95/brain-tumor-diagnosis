# Brain Tumor Diagnosis
This is the code base for my master's dissertation on 'Explainable Deep Learning for Brain Tumor Diagnosis'.

## Dataset
The [Brain tumor MRI dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dsv/2645886) available was Kaggle was used to train the proposed network. The dataset consists of glioma, meningioma, pituitary and no tumor classes.

## Methodology
An explainable, lightweight convolutional neural network inspired by feature pyramid networks and attention mechanisms was developed to address the issue of explainability in brain tumor classification. Class activation mapping (CAM) is utilized to provide visual explanations for the modelâ€™s predictions. Additionally, a novel weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) method that combines class activation maps with graph-based segmentation is proposed to generate tumor masks.

## Training and Evaluation
This project is implemented in PyTorch. Use the notebook [BT_diagnosis_5CV.ipynb](Colab%20Notebooks) to train and evaluate the base model and the attention integrated models. 

## Usage

Follow these steps to run the models and view the class activation maps.

### Clone and install the dependencies
```bash
git clone https://github.com/krodri95/brain-tumor-diagnosis.git
cd brain-tumor-diagnosis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Inference
`predict.py` runs inference on a single image and the results are saved to `exp/`. Select the model and the CAM technique.

```bash 
python predict.py --imgp assets/meningioma.jpg --model-type cbam --cam-type ScoreCAM
```

## Notes
Among the CAM techniques, Score-CAM provided better visual insights and highly localized class activation maps for meningiomas. The maps for pituitary tumors exhibited weak activations, while the maps for gliomas were inaccurate. The attention mechanisms enhanced the clarity of the visual explanations without significantly reducing the evaluation scores. While both Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) and Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) improved tumor localization in the class activation maps, the class discriminative maps from the CBAM integrated model were more precise and contained less noise.
